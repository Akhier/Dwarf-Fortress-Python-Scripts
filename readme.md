### EntitySeperateAndSort.py

Place in a folder with entity_[whatever] text files.
When run it will read all entity files,
move them all to a backup folder,
then make a seperate file for each entity with the tags organized.

### setDwarfFortressInit.py

Place in a folder with the init and d_init files.
When run it changes specific setting while leaving the rest of the file alone.
This makes it so any changes to the init in the future has less chance of messing this up.
