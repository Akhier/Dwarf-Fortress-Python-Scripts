### EntitySeperateAndSort.py

Place in a folder with entity_[whatever] text files.
When run it will read all entity files,
puts them in a timestamped zip folder,
then make a seperate file for each entity with the tags organized.

### setDwarfFortressInit.py

Place in a folder with the init and d_init files.
When run it changes specific setting while leaving the rest of the file alone.
This makes it so any changes to the init in the future has less chance of messing this up.

### EntityCreationGui

Work in progress.
Will end up being a gui to create a entity from scrap.
Though plans included to extend that to editing pre-existing entities.
This is part of what may end up being a all in one raw editing utility.
